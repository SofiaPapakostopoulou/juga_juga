## 🎯 Game Philosophy  

The rules of **Juga Juga** are designed with **simplicity and accessibility** in mind, ensuring that **any player, regardless of experience, can easily participate and enjoy the game**. My goal is to create a **fun and engaging experience** without complex instructions or difficult mechanics. The game’s structure is built for **seamless interaction**, allowing players to focus on having fun and socializing while promoting **responsible and safe gameplay**.

## 🔄 How to Play  

The game is played in **a series of rounds**, with the players taking turns in a **clockwise order**. The player who starts the game is the one who has **most recently been drunk**.

## 🃏 11.1 Game Setup  

1. Players choose **how many participants** will play.  
2. Players select **the number of decks** to be used.  
3. Each player is assigned a **nickname**, which will be used to refer to them during the game.

## 🎮 11.2 Gameplay  

### **🔴 Guessing the Color**  

- **Red** → The player guesses that the next card will be **red**.  
- **Black** → The player guesses that the next card will be **black**.  
- **Orange** → The player guesses that the next **two cards** will be one **red** and one **black** (order does not matter).  

### **🔄 Continuing the Guessing Sequence**  

- ✅ If the player **guesses correctly**, they continue to guess.  
- ❌ If the player **guesses wrong**, a **notification appears on the screen**, indicating who must drink the shots. The notification may determine that:  
  - The player drinks.  
  - The player’s friends drink.  
  - Everyone drinks together.  

### **🥃 Shot Amount Calculation**  

- The number of shots to be consumed equals **the number of correct guesses the player made before getting it wrong**.

## 🎉 11.3 Game Ending  

- The game **ends when all cards in the deck have been played**.  

At the end of the game, the focus is not on **competition** but on **joy, laughter, and shared fun**. In **Juga Juga**, there is **no single winner** based on **who drank the most or least**. Instead, the real goal is to create **memorable moments with friends**, where every laugh and moment of genuine joy is more valuable than any competitive victory.  

At the end of the night, the **true "winners"** are those who managed to drink **less**, because they spent their time **laughing at their drunk friends** and enjoying every moment together. This approach **transforms the game into an enjoyable experience**, where **laughter, social interaction, and responsible drinking** become the **real indicators of success**. Ultimately, **everyone is a winner** in **Juga Juga**, as the game fosters **togetherness and shared enjoyment**.
